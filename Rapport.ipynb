First, while for the Eurelian there is at least cases where we can determine if whether it is Eurelian with a simple check, in the Hamiltonian you will have to go through the whole graph every time before know if it is, or not. And then the requirement of the Eurelian is to go through only the Edges only once, that means that you can pass by vertex multiple times, which is less blocking that the hamiltonian condition of going through each vertex only once.\n",
